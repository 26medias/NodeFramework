The template engine is loaded as a library, and can be replaced or switch with ease.\r\n* NodeFramework's configuration is automatically rewritten in native PHP when changed.\r\n* Required server-side libraries are automatically \"hard wired\" as PHP includes, without any loop or condition.\r\n* Client-side libraries (JS and CSS files) are delivered on demand via a dedicated method which manage the dependencies, minification, concatenation (to deliver a single JS and a single CSS file) and cache the resulting tree and files for ultra-fast delivery on the next request.\r\n* Each application, theme and library has an \"ID file\", a file that give its unique name, version, metas (author, email, description, ...), dependencies, ...\r\n* Applications, themes and libraries are automatically detected by the framework. Copy-paste the folder in your project and you're done.\r\n\r\n### For developers\r\n* NodeFramework does not impose a coding style. You are free to use MVC is you wish, but you're also free to code in PHP inline (however I strongly advise against it). I personally use the CV model (Controller-View; I skip the Model layer on most projects)\r\n* Reuse your code: Copy-paste the folder of your libraries, themes or application from one project to another. No additional line of code required, they will be recognized automatically by the framework.\r\n* Backend: The framework has a built-in backend, protected, where you can manage the framework's conf, but where you can also access independent admin panels: Each application, Theme and library can have its own administration interface, with more than one interface. Admin interfaces are a special kind of application.\r\n* Default .htaccess handles basic URL-REWRITING and optimizes the HTTP headers for better caching and optimized delivery (.htaccess based on the HTML5 Boilerplate Project by Paul Irish - http://www.html5boilerplate.com/)\r\n\r\n### Install\r\n* Download and uncompress on your web server\r\n* Call /install\r\n* Default credentials: admin:admin\r\n\r\n### Requirements:\r\n* PHP 5.2\r\n* mod_rewrite","name":"Nodeframework","tagline":"A modular, easy-to-use PHP framework, allowing plug'n'play applications, libs and themes."}
