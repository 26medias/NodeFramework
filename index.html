        <h3>NodeFramework (3.0)</h3>

<p>NodeFramework is a flexible PHP framework that was developed with two goals in mind: Increasing the productivity of the developers, while being as simple to use as possible.
The learning curve is highly reduced, with developers being able to start developing on the framework in just 2 hours of training.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<ul>
<li>Pages are grouped in "Applications".</li>
<li>PHP functions are grouped in "Server-Side Libraries"</li>
<li>JS and CSS files are grouped in "Client-Side Libraries", with dependency management, minification, and caching.</li>
<li>Themes are available, and managed by Twig (Symfony's template engine). The template engine is loaded as a library, and can be replaced or switch with ease.</li>
<li>NodeFramework's configuration is automatically rewritten in native PHP when changed.</li>
<li>Required server-side libraries are automatically "hard wired" as PHP includes, without any loop or condition.</li>
<li>Client-side libraries (JS and CSS files) are delivered on demand via a dedicated method which manage the dependencies, minification, concatenation (to deliver a single JS and a single CSS file) and cache the resulting tree and files for ultra-fast delivery on the next request.</li>
<li>Each application, theme and library has an "ID file", a file that give its unique name, version, metas (author, email, description, ...), dependencies, ...</li>
<li>Applications, themes and libraries are automatically detected by the framework. Copy-paste the folder in your project and you're done.</li>
</ul><h3>For developers</h3>

<ul>
<li>NodeFramework does not impose a coding style. You are free to use MVC is you wish, but you're also free to code in PHP inline (however I strongly advise against it). I personally use the CV model (Controller-View; I skip the Model layer on most projects)</li>
<li>Reuse your code: Copy-paste the folder of your libraries, themes or application from one project to another. No additional line of code required, they will be recognized automatically by the framework.</li>
<li>Backend: The framework has a built-in backend, protected, where you can manage the framework's conf, but where you can also access independent admin panels: Each application, Theme and library can have its own administration interface, with more than one interface. Admin interfaces are a special kind of application.</li>
<li>Default .htaccess handles basic URL-REWRITING and optimizes the HTTP headers for better caching and optimized delivery (.htaccess based on the HTML5 Boilerplate Project by Paul Irish - <a href="http://www.html5boilerplate.com/">http://www.html5boilerplate.com/</a>)</li>
</ul><h3>Install</h3>

<ul>
<li>Download and uncompress on your web server</li>
<li>Call /install</li>
<li>Default credentials: admin:admin</li>
</ul><h3>Requirements:</h3>

<ul>
<li>PHP 5.2</li>
<li>mod_rewrite</li>
</ul>
